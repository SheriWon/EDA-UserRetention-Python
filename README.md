# Introduction
As a data analyst, it's imperative to recognize the evolving landscape of consumer behavior, particularly with the widespread integration of mobile technology. Online-to-offline (O2O) consumption has emerged as the dominant mode of consumer engagement, facilitated by the ubiquitous presence of mobile devices. This transition has led to an abundance of data generated daily, with various apps capturing billions of user interactions and location data points.

In this context, the strategic use of coupons has emerged as a crucial tool for businesses aiming to drive foot traffic and boost sales. However, the indiscriminate distribution of coupons often results in inconsequential disruptions for the majority of users. Such practices not only fail to engage customers effectively but also risk diluting the brand's reputation and pose challenges in estimating marketing expenses.
# Purpose
To address these issues, personalized coupon delivery has emerged as a pivotal technique. By leveraging data analytics, businesses can tailor coupon offerings to match individual consumer preferences, thereby enhancing the relevance and effectiveness of their marketing efforts. This approach not only ensures that consumers receive meaningful incentives but also empowers businesses with greater precision in targeting and optimizing their promotional strategies.
# Analysis Objectives

    - Identify factors influencing the level of foot traffic in stores.
    - Analyze customer spending habits.
    - Evaluate the utilization of distributed coupons.

# Finding
1. The busiest stores, frequented by the most customers, appear to be driven less by factors like proximity or discount intensity. Instead, their popularity likely stems from factors such as product quality or overall shopping experience.

2. The low redemption rate, with less than one-tenth of distributed coupons being utilized, suggests that the effectiveness of random coupon distribution is suboptimal. This highlights significant room for improvement, such as implementing targeted coupon strategies.

3. Personalized coupon delivery emerges as a critical technique for enhancing the core consumption rate of coupons. By analyzing consumer preferences, it's evident that a subset of consumers heavily relies on coupons, making them prime targets for personalized distribution efforts.

# Limitation and Improvement 

- Limited Variables: The analysis may be constrained by the variables included in the dataset. Important factors influencing customer behavior, such as business activities, socio-economic status, lifestyle preferences, or external market conditions, may not be captured, limiting the depth of analysis.
- Improvement: Collaborate with marketing team to conduct scenario analysis to explore the potential impact of different strategies or interventions on customer behavior. This helps in evaluating the effectiveness of alternative approaches and informing decision-making.
